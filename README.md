## Projects

### 1. **Flight Delay Data Analysis (AWS & Hive)**  
Developed predictive models to identify patterns and forecast flight delays across major airports and airlines.

- Processed 200K rows of flight data randomly sampled using Hive on AWS EMR
- Implemented feature engineering techniques to improve model performance
- Tested 3 different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to optimize predictions
- Achieved 88% prediction accuracy with the best-performing model
- Tools used: AWS EMR, Hive, Python, Scikit-learn

### 2. **NYC Electricity Forecasting Project (Python & Prophet)**
Developed time series forecasting models to predict electricity consumption patterns in New York City.
- Built 3 time-adaptive Prophet models for daily, monthly, and yearly consumption forecasting
- Automated time unit detection to forecast 100-365 days, 1-9 months, or 1-5 years ahead
- Optimized 5+ parameters including growth patterns, seasonality, and changepoints
- Achieved 92% RÂ² on daily model and reduced error by 17% through custom configurations
- Tools used: Python, Prophet, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
